    <h2>Tyler Morales</h2>
    <p>Ever since a young age, Iâ€™ve been interested in technology and design. From growing up with the internet,
      building countless projects and constantly having an urge to create anything, purposeful design has been important
      to me. Ultimately, this fascination with creativity and design has led me to find web development the perfect
      landscape to extend my passion towards building interactive and intuitive web experiences.</p>
    <p>Along with development, I am very active in the developer community online and in local Chicago meetups. I,
      amongst others, build up and motivate other like minded individuals, document our progress and learn the latest
      technologies with developers globally! Currently, I am studying Web Development and Design at Columbia College
      Chicago.</p>
